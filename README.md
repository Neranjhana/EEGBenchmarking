The study comprehensively evaluates various deep learning strategies to classify Motor Movement / Imagery using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, an area pivotal to advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This study spans several general Deep Learning methods and previously published works on the task. Focusing on the BCI Competition IV 2A dataset, we explored a range of pre-processing and feature extraction techniques, implemented and evaluated the performance of the benchmarked models, and tested the impact of Data Augmentation. The study also provides an additional perspective by testing the robustness of these models to the addition of noise at different SNR levels to replicate real-world data quality. Our findings provide crucial insights that could facilitate the development of more accurate and robust models.
